# Minesweeper
A little project that I wrote inspired by the project "Minesweeper" on Jetbrains Academy
Tried to make the code clear, concise and maintainable

Command line app, planning to make a GUI in the future

User is prompted for a coordinate to either mark as mine or free as a safe cell. Classic minesweeper rules apply.
